## Key Components

### Text Intelligence System
Real-time OCR and analysis with:
- Chat message parsing and filtering
- XP tracking and rate calculations
- Item recognition and value assessment
- Interface state detection
- Alert system for important events

### Computer Vision
Advanced detection capabilities:
- RuneLite client integration
- Interface element detection (tabs, orbs, inventory)
- Multi-resolution support
- Template matching with ML enhancement
- Real-time processing optimization

### GUI Framework
Professional interface featuring:

## Usage Examples

### Basic Text Intelligence
```python
from vision.osrs_ocr import osrs_text_intelligence
from core.text_intelligence import text_intelligence

# Capture and analyze
screenshot = capture_osrs_screen()
text_data = osrs_text_intelligence.analyze_game_text(screenshot)
intelligence = text_intelligence.analyze_text_intelligence(text_data)

# Access results
print(f"XP gained: {intelligence['xp_analysis']['session_xp']}")
print(f"Chat messages: {len(text_data['chat_messages'])}")
```

### Computer Vision Detection
```python
from vision.ultra_advanced_vision import UltraAdvancedVision

vision = UltraAdvancedVision()
screenshot = capture_osrs_screen()
game_state = vision.analyze_game_state(screenshot)

print(f"Active tab: {game_state.active_tab}")
print(f"Health: {game_state.player_status.health}")
print(f"Items found: {len(game_state.items)}")
```

## Development Guidelines

### Performance Standards
- Text processing: <100ms
- Computer vision: <50ms per frame
- Memory usage: <2GB
- GPU utilization: >70% (when available)

### Code Quality
